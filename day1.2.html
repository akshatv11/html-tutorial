                        Bad employee traits include a negative attitude about everything from work hours to coworkers to job assignments and lousy vending machines in the breakroom. Negativity zaps morale and can be contagious within the workplace. Constant complaining suggests the employee is a generally unhappy person who doesn't want to be there.
